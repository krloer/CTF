I hope you found an automatic solver for this, but if you did not, you hopefully learned more than most people who attempted this challenge. The challenge needs a lot of text for attacks to work, so I will ramble on a bit about the flag, if you do not mind. The final flag will consist of the word flag followed by a squiggly open bracket and then, in lower case, the sentence - classic ciphers are easy to break today - with underscores between the words. Finally, the flag will end with a squiggly closing bracket, as to follow the normal flag format.
flag{classic_ciphers_are_easy_to_break_today}
