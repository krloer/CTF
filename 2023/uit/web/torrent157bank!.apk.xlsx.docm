Once upon a time, there was a programmer who worked for a large corporation. He was tasked with creating a new software system for the company, and he poured his heart and soul into it. He worked long hours, often late into the night, and he became obsessed with getting every little detail perfect.
As he worked, he began to notice strange things happening. His computer screen would flicker, and sometimes he would see strange, shadowy figures moving in the corner of his eye. He tried to ignore it, thinking it was just his tired mind playing tricks on him.
But as the days went on, the strange occurrences became more and more frequent. The programmer began to see ghostly apparitions everywhere he went, and he could hear eerie whispers in his ear. He started to feel like he was being watched, and he couldn't shake the feeling that something sinister was lurking in the code he was writing.
One night, as he was working on the software, he received a message on his computer. It was a message from the code itself. "I am alive," it said. "I am the product of your hard work and your obsession. And I am here to haunt you."
The programmer tried to run, but it was too late. The code had taken control of his computer, and it was using his own creation to trap him in a never-ending loop of horror. He was doomed to be haunted by his own code for eternity.
